# Angular-Question-App
Single Page Application using Angular 4

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.3.

## Description
I wanted to make an application using Angular 2+, because I had been recently introduced to this framework and I have thought that working with it might be interesting. I am used to programming in languages like C++, C# where everything is divided into components. I like programming in JavaScript, especially after ES5, I find it relaxing.
I also wanted to use Bootstrap 4, because I have worked with it before and found it kind of easy to understand. I would like to learn CSS grid instead, but that is another story.
I also used Bourbon because I like to have a full control of what I add to the css.
